%Given a sequence of two grayscale images, computes the lucas-kanade
%algorithm on them to find the velocities in every region (of a given size)
%centered at given coordinates in the images
%image1 - first frame of the sequence
%image2 - second frame of the sequence
%window_size - window size
%c - x coordinates of the points of interest. The algorithm will calculate
%the velocities at square regions of window_size by window_size centered at
%the coordinates given by c and r. That is, the amount of arrows produced
%equals the lenght of c or r
%r - y coordinates of the points of interest. The algorithm will calculate
%the velocities at square regions of window_size by window_size centered at
%the coordinates given by c and r. That is, the amount of arrows produced
%equals the lenght of c or r
%Vx - x coordinates of the velocities. The velocity of the i'th window is
%given by (Vx(i), Vy(i))
%Vy - y coordinates of the velocities. The velocity of the i'th window is
%given by (Vx(i), Vy(i))
