%algorithm on them to find the velocities in every region (of a given size)

%square windows fit in the images
%Vx - x coordinates of the velocities. The velocity of the i'th window is
%given by (Vx(i), Vy(i))
%Vy - y coordinates of the velocities. The velocity of the i'th window is
%given by (Vx(i), Vy(i))
